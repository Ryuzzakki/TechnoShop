      <h6><i>With Passion For Real, Good Food</i></h6>
      <p>There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Pizza Store. Not our pizzas. Not our people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we’re at it. We’re the pizza company that lives life unboxed.</p>

      <h3>Pizzas</h3>
      <p>From day one, our company could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town — because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality.</p>
		<p>Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Store. That’s why pizza is in our name and always will be.</p>
